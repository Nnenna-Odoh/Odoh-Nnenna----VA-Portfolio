Sample Video Editing

I’m learning video editing with tools like Canva or [other tool you use]. Below is a description of a sample video I’d create for your program:

**Sample Video**: A 30-second promo for your Equine Empowerment Retreat. It would include clips of horses, nature, and text overlays like “Reclaim Your Joy!” with calming music.

*Note*: I’m happy to create a sample video using Canva or Clipchamp if you’d like to see one! Please let me know.
